      <h2>Our mission</h2>
      <p>
        In the Leave Me Alone office we're 100% committed to helping reduce the
        impact of spam emails on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we first began investigating how we could make a difference we were
        amazed to discover that the largest number of unwanted emails in inboxes
        actually originated from mailing lists that they had subscribed to
        themselves!
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually these types of emails wouldn't be considered spam, so are
        difficult to filter out.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Leave Me Alone was born to help get rid of emails that you signed up
        for, but no longer want.
