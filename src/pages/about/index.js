          <p>
            In the Leave Me Alone office we're 100% committed to helping reduce
            the impact of spam emails on the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we first began investigating how we could make a difference we
            were amazed to discover that the majority of unwanted emails were
            from mailing lists which had been subscribed to intentionally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually these types of emails wouldn't be considered spam, which
            makes them difficult to filter out.
          </p>
          <p>We set out to solve this problem by providing two things;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a way to see all spam, newsletters, and subscription emails</li>
            <li>
              a way to unsubscribe (not filter out) and get rid of those emails
              forever
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Leave Me Alone was born to help get rid of emails that you signed up
            for, but no longer want.

          <h2>The future</h2>
          <p>
            Our response to unwanted emails is primarily reactive. We
            unsubscribe if we don't need them in an ever-lasting battle to take
            back control of our inbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if we could stop the never-ending cycle of taking back control
            and continue to keep control?
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that this requires a shift from being reactive to being
            proactive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being proactive means we would never give our email to these
            subscriptions in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            We think that the new Subscriber Score is a powerful way of
            addressing this and we will be looking at ways we can use it to
            bring our users closer to this vision.

            We're Danielle and James, a couple of independent founders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between us we have; <strong>lead front-end teams</strong> for the UK
            Governments biggest software engineering department, spoken at (and
            organised!) <strong>international dev conferences</strong>, been
            among the first employees of <strong>pioneering UK startups</strong>
            , <strong>taught young students</strong> the basics of programming,
            and delivered <strong>consistently successful software</strong> as
            freelancers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now we work on products that help people because it's rewarding and
            we love it, which we think is a good reason to do just about
            anything!

          <p>
            We're building Leave Me Alone on our own without funding or outside
