          How is Leave Me Alone different from other services like Unroll.me?
        </h3>
        <p>
          When we scan your inbox we NEVER sell any of your data for marketing
          (it's been reported that Unroll.me do this, you can read about it in{' '}

          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          We actually unsubscribe you from the lists rather than just moving
          them to trash or applying a label. This is better for both your inbox,
          and the subscription service as they'll now know they have one less
          subscriber!

        <h3 className="faq-title">How do you unsubscribe from the lists?</h3>
        <p>
          If there's an unsubscribe link provided we follow it and unsubscribe
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sender didn't provide a link then we send an email on your
          behalf using the a unique address which identifies your subscription.

          If the provider{' '}
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8058">obeys the rules</a> then
          this should work, and you'll now be unsubscribed.
