          How is Leave Me Alone different from other services like Unroll.me?
        </h2>
        <p>
          When we scan your inbox we NEVER sell any of your data for marketing
          (it's been reported that Unroll.me do this, you can read about it in{' '}
          <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/personal-data-firm-slice-unroll-me-backlash-uber.html">

          </a>
          ).
        </p>
        <p>
          We actually unsubscribe you from the lists rather than just moving
          them to trash or applying a label. Those subscriptions are gone
          forever, even if you decide to stop using our service.

          How can you tell which emails are subscriptions?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We never read the content of any of your emails but we do have access
          to some metadata - information about an email which you donâ€™t usually
          see.
        </p>
        <p>
          This metadata contains information on how to unsubscribe from the
          mailing list which we can use.

      <div styleName="faq-box">
        <h2 styleName="faq-title">How do you unsubscribe me from emails?</h2>
        <p>
          If there's an unsubscribe link provided we follow it and unsubscribe
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sender didn't provide a link then we send an email on your
          behalf using a unique address which identifies your subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the provider{' '}
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8058">obeys the rules</a> then
          this should work, and you'll now be unsubscribed.

        <h2 styleName="faq-title">Why is Leave Me Alone not free?</h2>
        <p>
          Leave Me Alone is a paid service (so that you know we don't need to
          sell your data to keep afloat), but we've tried to keep our pricing as
          fair and affordable as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't store any email information and any emails we scan on your
          behalf are streamed directly to you and not stored by our system. This
          means you can be sure we will never exploit your data in order to keep
          our lights on.
