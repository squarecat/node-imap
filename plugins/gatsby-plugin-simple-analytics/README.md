# Simple Analytics Gatsby Plugin

Privacy friendly analytics without cookies and needed consent.

Install with `npm install gatsby-plugin-simple-analytics`.

## What does it do

It tracks page views with support for `pushState` navigation. It sends the data to [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com) and it will be available in your dashboard. You need to have a paid subscription for it to work.

## How to use

1. Add our plugin to `gatsby-config.js`

    ```js
    plugins: [
      'gatsby-plugin-simple-analytics'
    ]
    ```

1. If you want to set a custom domain, use this config:

    ```js
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-simple-analytics',
        options: {
          // Optional custom domain
          domain: 'your.custom.domain'
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    [Read our docs](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/bypass-ad-blockers) on the custom domain feature.

## Use with Metomic

[Metomic](https://metomic.io/) provides a privacy-by-design API to ethically manage your users' data. It's pretty cool.

If you want to use it with Metomic's `data-micropolicy` use this config:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-simple-analytics',
    options: {
      metomic: 'POLICY-SLUG'
    }
  }
]
```

It will result in something like this:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.simpleanalytics.io/hello.js" async="" defer="" type="text/x-metomic" data-micropolicy="POLICY-SLUG">
```
